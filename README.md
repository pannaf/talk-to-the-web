# Talk to the Web | Dynamically Chatting Sites

Built this for the AGI House Poe Previews Hackathon on 8/17/2024. Pretty good excuse to experiment with Poe Previews, Modal, and Fireworks AI.

Created a Poe Chatbot that accepts a link from a user, generates a preview of the HTML content from that website, and lets the user ask questions about the website content.

If you want to try this out yourself, you'll need to add your own API Key for Fireworks AI and your own Access Key for Poe. You'll also probably want a different Bot name, which you'll need to update in the code then. Don't forget to drop the server url in your Poe Bot under "edit bot" on Poe! Happy Hacking :)
